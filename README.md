# 🐶 Tindog Project

Tindog is a fun and responsive website built to showcase a fictional dating platform for dogs.  
I created this project on my own as a way to practice front-end development. The idea was inspired by Dr. Angela Yu’s *Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp*.

## 📌 Project Overview

Tindog is a simple yet stylish landing page that mimics popular dating apps, but with a twist — it's all about dogs finding their perfect match!  
The project helped me apply core web development skills in a creative and engaging way.
